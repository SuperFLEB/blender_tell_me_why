"Tell Me Why" addon.

Trust:
For trusting, show a trust dialog when a node with TMY is first clicked on.

If the user selects "Always trust", then:

1. Collect all formulas in the file
2. If the user doesn't have a Trust ID, create one (random string)
3. Append the Trust ID to the formula collection, and hash
4. Save the hash to the user's Trusted Hashes list, with filename and time
5. Attach "Trusted" and "Save Trust" flags to the file in a scope that will not be saved and will not stay with the session

When the user saves a file:
1. If the "Save Trust" flag is set, hash the formulas and the Trust ID as per above, and write the new value as a new always-trust hash to the preferences.

When the user opens a file:
1. Collect and hash all formulas in the file along with the user's Trust ID, as per above
2. If the hash matches any of the user's always-trust hashes in their preferences, set the "Trust" and "Save Trust" flags

If the user wants to un-trust a file, they can remove the Trust Hash from their preferences. Trust hashes should include file path and time

Settings Panel:
- Trust Keys (Original filename, Key)
- Distrust Keys (Original filename, Key)
- When formulas are encountered on an untrusted file:
    1. Ask whether to trust the file
    2. Never trust the file (Files can be added with "Trust this file" menu action)

[ ] If I create a formula for the first time, always trust the file
