"Tell Me Why" addon.

Trust:
For trusting, show a trust dialog when a node with TMY is first clicked on.
To remember trust, create a random "trust key" in a property attached to the file, and put it in the
    addon's preferences. If the file has a trust key and it matches, trust the file.
For security, ALWAYS APPEND NEWLY-GENERATED TRUST KEYS. NEVER USE UNKNOWN TRUST KEYS THAT ALREADY EXIST.
    (Otherwise, someone could sign a benign file with a known trust key, then use the same one on a malicious file)
Trust Actions:
    1. Always trust this file and its derivatives (Trust Key)
    2. Trust this file, but ask again if any formulas change (Formulas Hash)
    3. Do not trust this file
    4. Never trust this file or its derivatives (Distrust Key)
    5. More information / Formula Dump

Settings Panel:
- Trust Keys (Original filename, Key)
- Distrust Keys (Original filename, Key)
- When formulas are encountered on an untrusted file:
    1. Ask whether to trust the file
    2. Never trust the file (Files can be added with "Trust this file" menu action)

[ ] If I create a formula for the first time, always trust the file
