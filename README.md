# Tell Me Why

https://github.com/SuperFLEB/blender_tell_me_why

A Blender addon that lets you show the math and take notes on your nodes, so you're never left wondering _exactly why_ you set the scale on that input to 21.887.

## Features

* Add descriptive reminders to nodes and inputs
* Use variables and calculate values
* Save information with the Blender file

## To install

Either install the ZIP file from the release, clone this repository and use the
build_release.py script to build a ZIP file that you can install into Blender.

## To use

Do what comes naturally, I guess. (This is dummy copy. I'll need to add instructions once it's finished.)

## Testing

_Tests are currently not implemented._

To run unit tests, run (from the Blender install directory):

```shell
blender --factory-startup --background --python path/to/module/run_tests.py
```
